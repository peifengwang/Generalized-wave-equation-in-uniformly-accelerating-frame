Via Rindler's coordinate transformation, wave equation in frame moving at uniform acceleration $a$ along x axis becomes $\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x_a^2} + \frac{1}{x_a+\frac{c^2}{a}}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x_a} + \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial y_a^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial z_a^2} - \frac{c^2}{a^2(x_a+\frac{c^2}{a})^2}\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t_a^2}=0$. The equation reduces to the normal wave equation when acceleration $a=0$, thus it is a generalization of the normal wave equation. The generalized wave equation is invariant under coordinates transformation of Rindler metric. Several cases are studied with the generalized equation, 1) plane wave propagating along the uniform acceleration is derived, 2) there is a static solution of field of static point charge in uniform accelerating frame, 3) observed from a uniformly accelerating frame, field of freely falling charge is bound to the charge, 4) observed from an inertial frame, field of uniformly accelerating charge is bound to the charge.
